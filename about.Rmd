Hi! My name is Jonathon..., and that may be a lie. 

My actual name is George, and I am an aspiring data scientist, currently studying a Bachelor of Science in data science.

My passion and day-to-day habits lie in crunching and interpreting numbers. Realising that these attributes sound like those of a data scientist, I began my exploration and research in this field (soon realising data science was more than just number crunching).
